Some observations:

MongoDB Base doesn't work with NFS Partition - I observe that and see this problem because I use Linux (Debian) in my Workstation. So my second partition is in NFS format. 
To solve this problem, I put the repository in my first partition Ext4 and I deleted  ".meteor/local/db/mongod.lock" on my project. 

First I need to stop MongoDB Service because meteor reset erases everything in your local database when this service is Up. 

I wanna install two packages from bootstrap because the version 4 is more amazing and modern. But because that I have a lot of visual conflicts. And because that I remove Boostrap 4. 
The decision is because the version 4 package used a old version of Alpha Bootstrap. Because my short time to show this job I decide used the old version because in meteor packages
they have the last version of bootstrap-3, stable and secure.  With more time and reserch
